## Task-03: Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech

## Project Overview
Excited to announce the successful completion of Task-03 during my data science internship at Prodigy InfoTech ðŸš€. This project involved crafting a decision tree classifier in Python using Jupyter Notebook to predict customer purchases based on demographic and behavioral data.

## Project Description
Task-03 focused on building a decision tree classifier to predict whether customers would make a purchase based on their demographic and behavioral data. The project included data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the decision tree.

## Objectives
Import and clean data.
Visualize the distribution of a chosen variable using a bar chart or histogram.
Interpret the visualized data to derive meaningful insights.

## Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for data manipulation and visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive computing environment for writing and running code.
Pandas: Data manipulation library.
Matplotlib: Visualization library for creating static plots.
Seaborn: Statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
